			<br><p>In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savoury meal. 
                               The term "vegetable" is somewhat arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition. 
                               It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts and cereal grains, but includes seeds such as pulses. 
                               The original meaning of the word vegetable, still used in biology, was to describe all types of plant, as in the terms "vegetable kingdom" and "vegetable matter".
